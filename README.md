# Diff Highs and Gurobi

This project demonstrates the use of the HiGHS Python library for solving linear programming problems using the simplex method. It includes examples of setting up and solving optimization problems with HiGHS and Gurobi.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd diff_highs_and_gurobi
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project includes several Python scripts demonstrating different aspects of the simplex method and optimization with HiGHS and Gurobi:

- `4.3 The algebra of the simplex method.py`: Demonstrates the algebra behind the simplex method.
- `highs_example.py`: Provides an example of using HiGHS for solving a linear program.
- `or_p135-gurobi.py`: Example using Gurobi for optimization.
- `or_p135_highs.py`: Example using HiGHS for optimization.
- `setting_up_the_simplex_method.py`: Shows how to set up the simplex method using HiGHS.
- `svm.py`: Support Vector Machine example.
